Wurst- 2 Bot Category modules

EndermanBot is a automatic enderman farming module that uses baritone.

Its start by building a 3x3 roof above the player to then automatically manage multiple modules based on certain values.

The module will sometimes exits the safe area to go collect XP when there are no agro endermans nearby.

Was created for 1.12.2 and has been ported to 1.19.3 client called 0xJester, The module was created to be used apart of the Const Mapping project as i was testing the systems in the End.

I have plans on creating an Overworld version instead of farming just enderman it'll just explore and find any Animals and kill them all for the EXP to repair elytra to then automatically resume mapping.
